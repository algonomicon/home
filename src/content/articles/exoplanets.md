I came across the NASA open catalogue of exoplanets recently.[^1] It's a dataset of ~4000 confirmed planets that live outside of our solar system. Astronomy is in a super cool place right now.

There are monitoring projects all over the world, like the LSST project, collecting terabytes of information nightly.[^2] These projects are only going to grow larger as time goes on, which makes it a great candidate for data science. I'm super interested in astronomy as well so I'm excited to dive in to this dataset and explore the universe.

# Getting Ready

I downloaded a CSV from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=planets. It contains all 3974 confirmed exoplanets.
