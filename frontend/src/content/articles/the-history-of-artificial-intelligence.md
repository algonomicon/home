Artificial intelligence has a rich and ancient history. It has been a central tenet of human culture in one form or another for over 2000 years and over this time, I think artificial intelligence has acted as an avenue for people to ponder some of the greatest mysteries surrounding our humanity. These questions have cropped up in religous and philosophical discussions since the dawn of time. Are humans special? Is our intelligence a gift from god? Do we have free will? Why are we here and what is the meaning of life? What makes someone intelligent? Over millenia we have been studying ourselves and our thoughts, and in response, entire fields have developed. Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Physiology, Linguistics, Psychology, Sociology and now Computer Science. Understanding the human condition and our place in the universe is central to everything, and I think we are closer than ever to understanding a key piece of it.

## Antiquity

The oldest recorded examples of artificial intelligence come to us from Greek and Egyptian Mythology.
