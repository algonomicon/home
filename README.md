Hello world! This is the repo for algonomicon.com, a website for machine learning. I've experimented with a few different stacks through the development process and I'm really happy with what I've ended up with here. The frontend is a gatsby app and the backend is a sanity app. I was planning on building out the backend myself, but the sanity content studio offers so much out of the box that it was too hard to pass up. Development is still in process, but if you like what you see or have feedback for improvements, feel free to reach out to me here.
