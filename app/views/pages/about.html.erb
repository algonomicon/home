    <h2>What is Algonomicon?</h2>
    <p>Algonomicon is the home for machine learning engineers who want to become experts. We're collecting cutting edge research in the field and implementing it from scratch. We're forging a path to mastery through study and practice and we're hoping to recruit the ambitious along the way. The journey will be long and strenuous. Months of bitter cold and complete darkness await. Few will return but honor and recognition awaits those who do.</p>

    <h2>What's in a name?</h2>
    <p>The name Algonomicon comes from the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and his invented fictional grimoire called The Necronomicon. The Necronomicon is a collection of the darkest secrets of the universe, so powerful that people who read it are known to have gone mad.</p>
